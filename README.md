##Introduction
The Google Media Framework (GMF) is a lightweight media player designed to make video playback and integration with the Google IMA SDK on Android easier.

The framework is currently in beta, allowing interested developers to try it out and send feedback before we finalize the APIs and features.

##Features
- A customizable video player UI for video playback on Android
    - Logo and branding colors
    - Action buttons within video UI for other actions (ex. share or download)
    - Subtitle support
- Easily integrate the Google IMA SDK to enable advertising on your video content
- Built on top of [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)
    - Plays [MPEG DASH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) and mp4, and easily extended to other video formats
    - Does not yet support [HLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

##I want to use a newer version of Exoplayer
The Exoplayer library is located in the `libs` folder of the `googlemediaframework` module of this project as `exoplayer.jar`. If you want to update Exoplayer, you need to replace this with a new JAR.

To make a new JAR, please do the following:

1) Clone [Exoplayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer).

2) Run the `./gradlew jarRelease` command in the Exoplayer project.

3) Look in the `build` folder of the `library` module, there should be a file called `library.jar`. Again, this must be done in the Exoplayer project.

Then, rename `library.jar` to `exoplayer.jar` and put it into the `libs` folder of the `googlemediaframework` module of this project.

##Requirements

###Deployment
  - Android 4.1+

###Development
  - Gradle (1.12 or above)
